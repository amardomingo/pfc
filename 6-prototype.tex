\section{Overview of the system}

For this system, we developed a prototype utilising the architecture explained in chapter \ref{chap:architecture}. To do so, we deployed the following modules and subsystems:

\begin{enumerate}
 \item A Javascript client, that will connect to the system and act as an user interface.
 \item A Front-end controller, written in python, that will handle the interaction between the different modules-
 \item A chatbot using chatscript, to handle question analysis and chit-chat interaction.
 \item An Apache Solr instance, where all the semantic data will be loaded.
\end{enumerate}

In parallel to all this, both a web scraper using scrapy to recover the relevant data, and an uploader to post the data to Solr.
