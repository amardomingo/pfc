This project has focused in the design and implementation of a Personal agent integrated with a Linked data System, allowing users to interact with it using natural language.

In order to achieve our goal, we have studied state of the art technologies that would allow us to analyse natural language, retrieve and index semantic information, and present it to the user.

We have therefore proposed an architecture for our system that would allow us to perform these tasks, integrating a question answering system, a conversational agent with natural language processing capabilities, as well as an information retrieval system, along with a linked data indexing system.

Based on this architecture, we developed several prototypes to test it, the first one of them focusing on a simple example of e-learning in Spanish, providing with a platform to solve questions about the Java programming language, answering the student questions, and offering new topics so they can delve into their study.

A different prototype has studied the implementation of a similar system for a heterogeneous collection of documents in English, testing the student ability to design a modular system that can be easily extended.

Finally, we have analysed our first protoype in a real scenario, gathering information about its efficiency, the success rate while tested with a corpus, while we also proposed an experiment with users, comparing the system with traditional question answering systems, analysing the improvement in the results, the user experience, as well as the patterns in user behaviour while facing with a system like ours for the first time.
